    <section class="post-content">
      <p>It is not unknown for faked bite marks to reach court. A fictional example in the recent Wallace and Gromit film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, occurs when the Bake O Lite girl bites herself on the forearm, and has Gromit imprisoned for it.</p>

<p>Gromit’s defence should have been able to show that the mark, although definitely caused by teeth, was not a dog bite and was in a position where it could have been self inflicted. It should not have been necessary to construct casts of Gromit’s own teeth (for comparison with a measured, distortion-free photograph of the mark), but it could be done to show that the mark could not have been made with Gromit’s teeth – except that Gromit doesn’t actually have a mouth!</p>

<p>It would be expected that the Bake O Lite girl would refuse consent for dental impressions of her teeth; and since Wallace was the only other person present, dental casts of his teeth should have been able to eliminate him.</p>

<p>Although the example is fiction, and comedy at that, such events certainly occur in real life!</p>
